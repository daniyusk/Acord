## Fork and compatibility

Acord is a fork of Dorion. Some internal names and plugin endpoints intentionally retain the `Dorion` name to preserve compatibility with upstream Shelter components. For example, `Dorion Helpers` continues to load from `https://spikehd.dev/shelter-plugins/dorion-helpers/`; this refers to the upstream plugin, not the Acord product name.

> [!TIP]
> Acord can also be used portably or installed via [several package managers](#package-repositories).
> You can find portable builds in the [releases](https://github.com/SpikeHD/acord/releases/latest/) page. You can also [build](#building) Acord yourself!

> [!NOTE]
> ***MacOS Users***: If opening Acord gives you "Acord.app cannot be opened because it is from an unidentified developer", you may just need to run `sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Acord.app`. Alternatively, you can open the **Privacy & Security** settings pane and scroll down to the **Security** section to remove the quarantine.
>
> ***Windows Users***: Defender may think Acord is a virus. This just happens sometimes, and if SmartScreen blocks it from running, click "More Info" and "Run Anyways". Feel free to scan Acord with [Virustotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload)!

# Package Repositories

I do **not** maintain any instances of Acord in any package repositories myself, however some very kind people maintain some in their own spare time:

* Windows:
  * Shovel/Scoop (Maintained by [Small-Ku](https://github.com/Small-Ku/)):
    ```sh
    scoop bucket add turbo 'https://github.com/Small-Ku/turbo-bucket.git'
    scoop install turbo/acord
    ```
  * WinGet (Maintained by [headquarter8302](https://github.com/headquarter8302))
    ```sh
    winget install --id daniyusk.Acord
    ```
* Linux:
  * Arch AUR (Maintained by [YouKnow-sys](https://github.com/YouKnow-sys))
    ```sh
    yay -S acord-bin
    ```
  * NixOS
    ```sh
    nix-shell -p acord
    ```
* MacOS:
  * Homebrew (Maintained by [psharma04](https://github.com/psharma04))
    ```sh
    brew tap psharma04/acord
    brew install --cask acord
    ```

> [!NOTE]
> Maintaining Acord in a different package repository that I don't know about? Feel free to [open a PR](https://github.com/daniyusk/Acord/pulls) to add it here!

# Features

* [Significantly smaller](https://github.com/SpikeHD/Dorion/assets/25207995/eb603f1f-f633-4913-a25e-1316b495a08a) than the original Discord client and other web-based alternatives
* Theme support
* Global push-to-talk and custom keybinds
* [Shelter](https://github.com/uwu/Shelter) and (optionally) [Vencord](https://github.com/vendicated/vencord)/[Equicord](https://github.com/equicord/equicord) included out of the box
* Full [RPC/game presence](https://github.com/SpikeHD/rsRPC) support included out of the box.
  * This also requires either the [shelteRPC](https://github.com/SpikeHD/shelter-plugins?tab=readme-ov-file#shelterpc) or [arRPC](https://vencord.dev/plugins/WebRichPresence%20(arRPC)) plugins to be enabled
* (Hopefully) better low-end system performance, YMMV
* ARM support for all platforms
* Feature flags for those who build from source

## Plugins

Acord comes with [shelter](https://github.com/uwu/shelter), so that should cover at least some plugin-related needs. You can also enable client mods like [Vencord](https://github.com/vendicated/vencord) inside the Acord settings page.
If you want to install plugins not available within the Acord settings page, ensure you are downloading a browser-compatible version.

> [!NOTE]
> Want official support for another client mod? As long as it works on the web, feel free to submit a [feature request](https://github.com/daniyusk/Acord/issues/new/choose)!

> [!TIP]
> Unsure what shelter plugins exist out there? There's more than you think! Try searching `shelter plugins` on GitHub, or use the Plugin Browser plugin:
>
> `https://spikehd.github.io/shelter-plugins/plugin-browser/`

## Themes

Acord supports all themes, BetterDiscord and others, with a [couple caveats](#known-issues).

[^1]: Windows 7 support is possible by installing API extensions, such as VxKex. It could break at any point, and if this happens, I probably won't put much effort into fixing it (PRs always welcome of course!). You may also need to manually install [WebView2](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/) if Acord doesn't open after installing!

[^2]: Some people report Acord freezing on Linux, particularly when GIFs are playing. This is, as far as I can tell, a bug in WebkitGTK.

[^3]: Support for WebRTC is hidden behind a build-time flag that is unused in most distros, and if it were, the implementation is still incomplete. This will be available when WebkitGTK ships with WebRTC support.

# Building

## Prerequisites

* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org)
* [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/)
* [Rust and Cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
* [Tauri prerequisites](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/)

## Steps

1. Clone/download the repository
2. Open a terminal window in the root project folder
3. Install JS dependencies:

    ```sh
    pnpm install
    ```

4. Pull the latest shelter build (this is used as a backup if it cannot be fetched on the fly)

    ```sh
    pnpm shupdate
    ```

5. Build the updater

    ```sh
    pnpm build:updater
    ```

6. (Linux-only) Build the WebKitGTK extension
    ```sh
    cd src-tauri/extension_webkit
    cmake .
    cmake --build .
    ```

7. Build!

    ```sh
    # Build Acord...
    pnpm tauri build

    # ...or to debug/open in dev mode
    pnpm dev
    ```

All built files will be in `src-tauri/target/(release|debug)/`. Installation files (eg. `.msi`, `.deb`) are located in `bundle/`.

# Known Issues

* (non-Windows) External images (UserBG, Decor, UserPFP, etc.) will not load
* (non-Windows) Fonts/font-faces will not load
* Everything else in [the issues page](https://github.com/daniyusk/Acord/issues)

# Troubleshooting

## Things you Might be Asked to Provide

If you submit an issue or ask a question in the Discord, it's likely you will be asked for the following, so please provide them if you can:

* Devtools console output (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> <kbd>i</kbd>, then click "Console")
* `latest.log` output
  * Windows: `%appdata%\acord\logs`
  * Linux: `~/.config/acord/logs`
  * MacOS: `~/Library/Application Support/acord/logs`

## General

### I can't see Acord Settings!
* Check if `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/` URLs are being blocked by any system-wide adblockers/firewalls
* Check the devtools console to see if there are any relevant errors

### "Oops! Something went wrong."
(or a similar client crash)
* Disable non-vital client mods/plugins/extensions and try again.
* If you cannot get to the settings menu, you can delete the following items:
  * Windows: `%appdata%\acord\webdata` & `%appdata%\acord\config.json`
  * Linux: `~/.config/acord/webdata` & `~/.config/acord/config.json`
  * MacOS: `~/Library/Application Support/acord/webdata` & `~/Library/Application Support/acord/config.json`

## Windows
### Acord not opening
* Try installing via MSI instead of the `.zip` file
* Try using the `.zip` file instead of the MSI
* (If using the `.zip` file) make sure all files were extracted properly. Ensure you are extracting Acord and it's contents into it's own folder.
* [Reinstall WebView2](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/)
  * Fully uninstall and reinstall.
  * If you are having trouble uninstalling it, or the installer says its already installed even though you uninstalled, try deleting this registry folder and uninstalling again `Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Microsoft\EdgeUpdate\Clients\{F3017226-FE2A-4295-8BDF-00C3A9A7E4C5}`

## Linux
### White/blank/frozen screen
* Run Acord with either, or both, of the following environment variables:
  ```sh
  WEBKIT_DISABLE_COMPOSITING_MODE=1
  WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1
  ```

# Using Plugins, Extensions, and Themes

Plugins, extensions, and themes are relatively simple to use, the file structure looks like so on Windows:

```
C:/Users/%USERNAME%/acord/
    ├── plugins/
    |   └── plugin.js
    ├── extensions/
    |   └── some_unpacked_extension/
    └── themes/
        └── theme.css
```

and like so on Linux:

```
~/.config/acord/
    ├── plugins/
    |   └── plugin.js
    └── themes/
        └── theme.css
```

so if you download a plugin, extension, or theme, just pop it into the `plugins`/`extensions`/`themes` folder. If you need help finding them, there are buttons in Acord settings that'll take you where you need!

> [!NOTE]
> Themes can also be installed by clicking `Install Theme from Link` in Theme settings, if you prefer
